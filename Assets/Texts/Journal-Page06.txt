The screams are really annoying now. First, it started as some yelps during the day
but now I hear them even during the night. The voices in my head...I do not go out
if I do not have to, people look at me weird. Also now with those murders... poeple 
running around screaming their lungs out, plucking their hair out, throwing themselves under carriages...
I have never been so scared.

I've spent this night in the machine room. She is the only one who provides me some comfort...
Some time during the night a heard foot steps...

"YOU DID GOOD."

-----------------------------------------------------------

(obr.)

I recognized that face allright...

"Thanks."

???
Everything is ready... it will all be over soon...
I also used this remaining time to ask my machine my final question. I did not find the courage to look 
at the answer yet but I think I know the answer...
