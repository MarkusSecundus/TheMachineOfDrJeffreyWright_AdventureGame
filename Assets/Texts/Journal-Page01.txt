15th of July, 1884

For the past few days, I've been having nightmares...
In those dreams there is a man. He tells me things... things that
could change the world... "The Great Science"...
in the dreams I nod in understanding of what needs to be done but when I wake up...
I remember... nothing, NOTHING.

Day by day, the Man grows more and more angry. 
"Why haven't you done it yet?", "What is taking you so long?"
... I am afraid to sleep now. I haven't eaten in days either... The light
in my soul is dwingling. Hopefully, it will end soon...

16th of July, 1884
Today morning, I woke up. Feeling refreshed and full of energy like never before.
No recollection of any nightmare as well. Joyfully, I jump out of bed, ready to leave
this chapter behind, to finish my research... to see my love, Eleanor... 
Then, I glanced at my chalkboard...

(obr.)

The scriptures... the handwriting was indeed mine but I do not remember writing
any of these... The words, the symbols look familiar however. Oh, I know now.
I REMEMBER NOW... all those dreams. I know what must be done, everything else must wait...
