Epilogue - Bad Ending

I searched his house and read his journal... it seems that all the craziness
is envoked by that machine. All those mad people must have asked the machine
a question. Perhaps the knowledge of the future did something to their brains?
But I will never know for sure until I find Mr. Wrigth, the mad scientist.

How many people were there? Could there be a cure to help them? 

I will not rest, Mr. Wright must be found... and as soon as possible...

Perhaps, this lady Eleanor could lead me somewhere...

Epilog - Worse Ending


Huh? What's that? I must have a brought the thing back to life... Oh look, it
spits out some words... "YES NO NO YES"... what a weird piece of crap this is.
Is this what you were so obsessed about, Mr. Wright? Crazy man indeed...

But what now with all those poeple in the Asylum... You surely will be no help
since you are dead. Uff, I should show my findings to the scientist 
and doctors at the psych ward. They will have to figure something out.

Huh, what was that?

I thought I heard something... or someone... a man's voice...

Huh, again...

"SOON, IT WILL ALL BE OVER SOON."
