Today is the 9th of October, 1886. My name is Nicholas Thornton and I am a detective here in London.
I am very tired, my own thoughts do not let me sleep however... in this cases, my psychiatrist advised me to 
put everything on paper. It will ease my mind, he says. 

Today, it will be a month since the first murder. They found her on the street, not a nice sight to see... a lot of blood.
However, an easy case to solve that was, the murderer did not get far away, just a few streets, screaming and rocking like a child
with the weapon still in his hand...

And then, it happened again... a body covered in blood, cuts and bruises all over. And the guilty standing over him, mounth open in
a silent scream... 

...and then it happened again...

...and again and again... 

...now, there is a full floor of these crazy people in Asylum.

This is no coincidence, something must have happened to them and I need to figure out what... 

... Dr. Jeffrey Wrigth, a scientist who became quite popular recently. Charlatan I say he is. The thing he made... well anyway,
all the culprits knew him and now he also mysteriously disappeared.

Time is running short, more and more people grow violent, I cannot wait for that quack to return... I hope he would not
mind if I checked his house... after all, an open window is nothing but an invitation...
