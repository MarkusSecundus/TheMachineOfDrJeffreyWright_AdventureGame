29th of April, 1885

My luck seems to be running dry as the incoming flow of crap looks
to be neverending... Tonight, I again heard noises from downstairs.
I am not bothered to get up from bed anymore to check. So, I just closed
my eyes and tried to fall back asleep. And then I heard a man's screach...
short and but only one. I rushed to the machine room, with gun in my hand
ready to face whoever I was going to find.
I looked left and right, seeing noone, I looked to the center of the room and there
was laying on the floor some man.
"Hands up or I shoot!," I shouted at the man. No response. With the gun still aiming
at his back, I went nearer. As I approached him, I noticed that he was not moving. Not at all...
He was laying on his stomach. I checked his pulse to find none. Sweat started to run on my back
and on my brow.
I turned him around to see his face...

... I flinched in shock. The man must have died a horryfying death. I did not think
much more of that because laying next to the man were notes... notes about the structure
of MY MACHINE... he tried to STEAL MY INVENTION. I fell no pity for him after this realization.
Nevertheless, I have now body to get rid off. GREAT! Thankfully, I have an idea...
