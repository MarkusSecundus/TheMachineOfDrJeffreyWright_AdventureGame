After weeks of searching, I finally found the house.

There is no light to be seen through the windows. And the garden is awfully overgrown, as if no one tended to it in years. 
But still, it matches the description perfectly...

The house. One, which so many of my patients remember as the beginning of their madness

Hoping not to provoke the inhabitants, I would come here now and then and try knocking politely on the door. However, there was no response.

It took two days for my curiosity to outmatch my restraint and finally break into the house. The door was locked, but its wood so rotten, it crumbled after a single kick.
