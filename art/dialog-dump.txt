Prologue:

###Begin
>
Today is the 9th of October, 1886. 
My name is Nicholas Thornton and I am a detective here in London.
>
I am very tired... my own thoughts do not let me sleep. 
However... in cases like these, my psychiatrist advised me to put everything on paper.
It will ease my mind, he says.

Well, let's see...
>
Today, it will be a month since the first murder.
>
They found her on the street, not a nice sight to see... a lot of blood.
However, an easy case to solve that was, the murderer did not get far away, just a few streets, screaming and rocking like a child with the weapon still in his hand...

...and then it happened again...
>
...and again and again... 
>
...now, there is a full floor of these crazy people in the Asylum.
>
This is no coincidence, something must have happened to them and I need to figure out what... 
>
... Dr. Jeffrey Wrigth, a scientist who became quite popular recently. 
Charlatan I say he is. The thing he made... well anyway, all the culprits knew him and now he also mysteriously disappeared.
>
Time is running short.
More and more people grow violent. I cannot wait for that quack to return... 
I hope he would not mind if I checked his house...
>
After all, an open window is nothing but an invitation...

	Still shiny as new...

EpilogueBad:

###Begin
>
I searched his house and read his journal...

...it seems that all the craziness is envoked by that machine.
>
All those mad people must have asked the machine a question.
Perhaps the knowledge of the future did something to their brains?
But I will never know for sure until I find Mr. Wright, the mad scientist.
>
How many people were there? Could there be a cure to help them? 
>
I will not rest, Mr. Wright must be found... 
...and as soon as possible...
>
Perhaps, this lady Eleanor could lead me somewhere...

###Begin

Huh? What's that?
[begin MachineSound()]
>
I must have brought the thing back to life...
>
Oh look, it spits out some words... "YES NO NO YES"... what a weird piece of crap this is.
>
Is this what you were so obsessed about, Mr Wright? Crazy man indeed...
>
But what now with all those people in the Asylum...
You surely will be no help since you are dead.
>
Uff, I should show my findings to the scientists and doctors at the psych ward.
They will have to figure something out.
>
...........................................................................................................................
>
Huh, what was that?

I thought I head something...
... or someone...
... a man's voice...

Huh, again...

"SOON... IT WILL ALL BE OVER SOON."
