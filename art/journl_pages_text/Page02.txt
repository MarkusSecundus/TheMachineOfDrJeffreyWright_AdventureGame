At last! After all the hard work, it is done. My new machine. 
Getting funding was tricky... but after pointing a gun at his head
and threating to poison his family with cyanide made him finally
oblige... And here it is.

A machine that could predict the future... People would come and ask the machine
a question, "Is it going to rain tommorow?", and the machine would write its answer
on a strip of tape...

(obr.)

The machine can answer only YES and NO questions but it is enough. And it is working.

Last week, I showed my invention to "the Comitee of Science for the Future" in London.
They were not pleased. They called me a charlatan, a no-scientins and an idiot. One
of them even jokingly asked:"Am I gonna kick a bucket in a week?". To which my machine
answered "YES". The FAT FUCK started laughing and the others as well. I could not stand it
anymore, so I packed my things and ran from there ashamed. But after reading todays newsletter,
it is I who is laughing now... that fat pig died today morning of stroke. I am expecting a letter
from the Comitee any day now.
