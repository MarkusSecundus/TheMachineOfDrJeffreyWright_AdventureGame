3rd of March 1885

After reexaming mine invention, the Comitee granted me the patent
for my machine. Now, I could show my invention to the public 
without worrying that someone would steal my idea (well, not entirely mine...).
It took some time but my machine became a great success...

People stand in line for hours to ask my machine something... for a price of course..
Well, I have become quite rich... Finally, I can take Eleanor to that vacation,
that I've been promising her to celebrate our 15th anniversary... 
(I have hidden all the necessarry documents in my safe. It will be a surprise for her
... if only she knew that the combination is the year we have met...)

Something seems off... I've started to hear noises at night,
in the room where I store my machine. But whenever I go there to check,
there is nothing. Not a soul in sight. I guess rats found their way in...

13th of April, 1885

Today, I returned from a hospital. All I can remember is some old cow screaming at me
on a street. "It is your fault!". I recollect staring at her in confusion. I tried 
to get away but she followed, her yells getting more and more annoying.
"Beacuse of you, my husband is dead!" I turned to face her... Then a glimpse of a black smudge,
sharp pain accross my face and darkness...
Thankfully, I survived getting smacked into a face with a frying pan wihtout any permanent damage.
I also found out that her husband came to my shop... asked if he is going to climb to the peak
of some moutain... he forgot to ask if he is going to come back though.
