1st of May, 1885

I feel like killing myself. We faught with Eleanor... She said my machine
is EVIL and the product of the Devil and that I should get rid of it.
Has she gone mad?! Of course I am not doing such a stupid thing. MY MACHINE.
All that I've done for her, my machine. The sweat, the blood...
Let Eleanor be gone... I don't need her... when I have MY MACHINE...
She will never leave, she will stay...

It has been a while since I have written to my journal... with Eleanor gone
I have started to spend my money elsewhere... needless to say I have now my cellar
full of bottless of wine (most of them empty...)... Also, I am now having nightmares
again. And some weirdass voice is telling me about some BLOOD rituals... 
Heh, the only red thing flowing around here will be a good Cabernet.
